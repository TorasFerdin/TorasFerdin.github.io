<h1><em>Quick hummus recipe</em></h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, <u>with no messing.</u></strong> It has been adapted from a number of
  different recipes that I
  have <q>read</q> over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty
  with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

  For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
  chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>
  Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.<br>
  You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.<br>
  If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>

<blockquote>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months. O<sub>2</sub>
